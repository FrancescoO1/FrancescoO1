## 👋 Hi there! I'm a Telecommunications and Computer Engineering Student

My name is Francesco, and I’m building my path through bits, waves, and algorithms.  
I'm passionate about both the world of **telecommunications**, where information travels through space, and **computer science**, where it takes shape and meaning.
I believe that curiosity is the key to learning: every line of code or formula is one more step towards understanding **how the systems that connect our world really work**.
